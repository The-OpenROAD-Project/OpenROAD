        #### To reproduce the bug:
        ##### You have two options here:

        A. Use `make <SCRIPT_NAME>_issue` to create a tar file with all the files to reproduce the bug(s).

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Head to the flow directory e.g "./flow"

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Set the ISSUE_TAG variable to rename the generated tar file

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Run `make {script}_issue` in the directory "OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow" where script is wildcarded from the "OpenROAD-flow-scripts/scripts" directory e.g `make cts_issue`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Upload the generated tar file

        B. Upload relevant files

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Upload a tar file containing the relevant files (.def, .lef and flow.tcl).

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- List the commands used.
