This is a compilation of many idioms in openroad code that I consider
undesirable. Obviously other programmers have different opinions or
they would be so pervasive.  James Cherry 04/2020

Don't comment out code.
Remove it.
git provides a complete history of the code if you want to look backwards.
Huge chunks of commented out code that are stunningly common in student
code makes it nearly impossible to read.

FlexTa.cpp has 220 lines of code and 600 lines of commented out code.

....

Don't use prefixes on function names or variables.
That's what namespaces are for.
namespace fr {
class frConstraint
class frLef58CutClassConstraint
class frShortConstraint
class frNonSufficientMetalConstraint
class frOffGridConstraint
class frMinEnclosedAreaConstraint
class frMinStepConstraint
class frMinimumcutConstraint
class frAreaConstraint
class frMinWidthConstraint
class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinEndToEndConstraint
class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinParallelEdgeConstraint
class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinMaxMinLengthConstraint
class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineWithinConstraint
class frLef58SpacingEndOfLineConstraint
ad nauseum

....

Don't use extern on function definitions.
It is pointless in a world with prototypes.

namespace fr {
  extern frCoord getGCELLGRIDX();
  extern frCoord getGCELLGRIDY();
  extern frCoord getGCELLOFFSETX();
  extern frCoord getGCELLOFFSETY();
}

....

Don't use prefixes on file names.
That's what directories are for.

frDRC.h
frDRC_init.cpp
frDRC_main.cpp
frDRC_setup.cpp
frDRC_util.cpp

....

Don't name variables theThingy or curThingy.
It is just distracting extraneous verbage.
Just use thingy.

           float currXSize;
	   float currYSize;
	   float currArea;
	   float currWS;
	   float currWL;
	   float currWLnoWts;

....

Do not use global varaibles.
All state should be inside of classes.

extern std::string DEF_FILE;
extern std::string GUIDE_FILE;
extern std::string OUTGUIDE_FILE;
extern std::string LEF_FILE;
extern std::string OUTTA_FILE;
extern std::string OUT_FILE;
extern std::string DBPROCESSNODE;
extern std::string OUT_MAZE_FILE;
extern std::string DRC_RPT_FILE;
extern int MAX_THREADS ;
extern int VERBOSE     ;
extern int BOTTOM_ROUTING_LAYER;
extern bool ALLOW_PIN_AS_FEEDTHROUGH;
extern bool USENONPREFTRACKS;
extern bool USEMINSPACING_OBS;
extern bool RESERVE_VIA_ACCESS;
extern bool ENABLE_BOUNDARY_MAR_FIX;
....
ad nauseam

....

Do not use continue.
Wrap the body in an if instead.

instead of
  for(dbInst* inst : block->getInsts() ){ 
    // Skip for standard cells
    if( (int)inst->getBBox()->getDY() <= cellHeight) { 
      continue;
    }

use

  for(dbInst* inst : block->getInsts() ){ 
    // Skip for standard cells
    if( (int)inst->getBBox()->getDY() > cellHeight) { 

....

Don't put magic numbers in the code.
Use a variable with a name that captures the intent.

examples of unnamed magic numbers:
  coeffV = 1.36;
  coeffV = 1.2;
  double nearest_dist = 99999999999;
  if(dist < rowHeight * 2)
  for(int i = 9; i > -1; i--) {
  if(design_util > 0.6 || num_fixed_nodes > 0) div = 1;
  avail_region_area += (theRect->xUR - theRect->xLL - (int)theRect->xUR % 200 +
           (int)theRect->xLL % 200 - 200) *
          (theRect->yUR - theRect->yLL - (int)theRect->yUR % 2000 +
           (int)theRect->yLL % 2000 - 2000);

....
	   
Don't copy code fragments.
Write functions.
10x int x_pos = (int)floor(theCell->x_coord / wsite + 0.5);
15x int y_pos = (int)floor(y_coord / rowHeight + 0.5);

This
 nets[newnetID]->netIDorg = netID;
 nets[newnetID]->numPins = numPins;
 nets[newnetID]->deg = pinInd;
 nets[newnetID]->pinX = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 nets[newnetID]->pinY = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 nets[newnetID]->pinL = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 nets[newnetID]->alpha = alpha;

Should factor out the array lookup.
 Net *net = nets[newnetID];
 net->netIDorg = netID;
 net->numPins = numPins;
 net->deg = pinInd;
 net->pinX = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 net->pinY = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 net->pinL = (short *)malloc(pinInd * sizeof(short));
 net->alpha = alpha;

Same here:

        if(grid[j][k].group != UINT_MAX) {
          if(grid[j][k].isValid == true) {
            if(groups[grid[j][k].group].name == theGroup->name)
              area += wsite * rowHeight;
          }
        }


....

Don't use malloc.
Use new.
We are writting C++, not C.

....

Don't reinvent functions like round, floor, abs, min, max.
Use the std versions
  int size_x = (int)floor(theCell->width / wsite + 0.5);

....

Don't use C abs, fabs or fabsf.
They fail miserably if the wrong arg type is passed to them.
Use std::abs.

....

Fold code common to multiple loops into the same loop.
Each of these functions loops over every instance like this:
  legal &= row_check(log);
  legal &= site_check(log);
    for(int i = 0; i < cells.size(); i++) {
    cell* theCell = &cells[i];
  legal &= power_line_check(log);
  legal &= edge_check(log);
  legal &= placed_check(log);
  legal &= overlap_check(log);

with this loop
for(int i = 0; i < cells.size(); i++) {
  cell* theCell = &cells[i];

Instead make one pass over the instances doing each check.

....

Don't use == true, or == false.
      if(found.first == true) {

Boolean expressions have a value of true or false already.

is simply

      if(found.first) {

and

      if(found.first == false) {

is simply

      if(!found.first) {

....

Don't nest if statements.
Use && on the clauses instead.

        if(grid[j][k].group != UINT_MAX) {
          if(grid[j][k].isValid == true) {
            if(groups[grid[j][k].group].name == theGroup->name)

is simply 

        if(grid[j][k].group != UINT_MAX
           && grid[j][k].isValid
           && groups[grid[j][k].group].name == theGroup->name)

....

Don't change compile flags in cmake files.
 set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O3")
 set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "-g -ggdb")
 set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "-O3")

....

Don't put /'s in cmake directory names.
Cmake knows they are directories.
 target_include_directories( ABKCommon
   PUBLIC
   ${ABKCOMMON_HOME}
   src/
   )

....

Don't put /'s in .gitignore directory names.
 test/

....

Don't put file names in .gitignore ignored directories.
 test/results
 test/results/diffs

....

Don't use <>'s to include anything but system headers.
Your project's headers should NEVER be in <>'s.
  #include <opendb/db.h>
  #include <ABKCommon/uofm_alloc.h>
....

Don't list compile artifacts in .gitignore
They all end up in the build directory so each file type does not have
to appear in .gitignore.

All of the following is nonsense that has propagated faster than covid
in student code:

# Compiled Object files
*.slo
*.lo
*.o
*.obj

# Precompiled Headers
*.gch
*.pch

# Compiled Dynamic libraries
*.so
*.dylib
*.dll

# Fortran module files
*.mod
*.smod

# Compiled Static libraries
*.lai
*.la
*.a
*.lib

....

Use pragma once instead of #define to protect headers from being read more
than once. The #define symbol has to be unique, which is difficult to
guarantee.

Instead of:
#ifndef __MACRO_PLACER_HASH_UTIL__
#define __MACRO_PLACER_HASH_UTIL__
  <contents>
#endif

use
#pragma once

....

Don't put "using namespace" inside a function.
It makes no sense what so ever but I have seen some very confused
programmers do this far too many times.

....

Don't nest namespaces.
We don't have enough code to justify that complication.

....

Don't use "using namespace"
It is just asking for conflicts and doesn't explicity declare what
in the namespace is being used.
Use "using namespace::symbol; instead.
And especially NEVER EVER EVER "using namespace std". It is HUGE.

  using namespace odb;

The following is especially confused because it is trying to "use" the
symbols in code that is already in the MacroPlace namespace.

using namespace MacroPlace;

namespace MacroPlace { 
}

....

Use nullptr instead of NULL.
This is the C++ approved version of the ancient C #define.
