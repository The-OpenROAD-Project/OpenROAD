# TritonCTS 2.0
TritonCTS 2.0 is the clock tree synthesis engine of The OpenROAD Project.

### Usage
TritonCTS 2.0 is available under the OpenROAD app as ``clock_tree_synthesis`` command.
The following tcl snippet shows how to call TritonCTS. TritonCTS 2.0 performs on-the-fly characterization.
Thus there is no need to generate characterization data. On-the-fly characterization feature could still
be optionally controlled by parameters specified to cts_configure_characterization command.
Use set_wire_rc command to set clock routing layer.

```
read_lef "mylef.lef"
read_liberty "myliberty.lib"
read_def "mydef.def"
read_verilog "myverilog.v"
read_sdc "mysdc.sdc"
set_wire_rc -clock -layer metal5

Argument description:
- ``-buf_list`` are the master cells (buffers) that will be considered when making the wire segments.
- ``-root_buffer`` is the master cell of the buffer that serves as root for the clock tree. 
If this parameter is omitted, the first master cell from ``-buf_list`` is taken.
- ``-max_slew`` is the max slew value (in seconds) that the characterization will test. 
If this parameter is omitted, the code would use max slew value for specified buffer in buf_list from liberty file.
- ``-max_cap`` is the max capacitance value (in farad) that the characterization will test. 
If this parameter is omitted, the code would use max cap value for specified buffer in buf_list from liberty file.
- ``-slew_inter`` is the time value (in seconds) that the characterization will consider for results. 
If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the default value (5.0e-12). Be careful that this value can be quite low for bigger technologies (>65nm).
- ``-cap_inter`` is the capacitance value (in farad) that the characterization will consider for results. 
If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the default value (5.0e-15). Be careful that this value can be quite low for bigger technologies (>65nm).
- ``-wire_unit`` is the minimum unit distance between buffers for a specific wire. 
If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the value from ten times the height of ``-root_buffer``.
- ``-clk_nets`` is a string containing the names of the clock roots. 
If this parameter is omitted, TritonCTS looks for the clock roots automatically.
- ``-out_path`` is the output path (full) that the lut.txt and sol_list.txt files will be saved. This is used to load an existing characterization, without creating one from scratch.
- ``-post_cts_disable`` is a flag that, when specified, disables the post-processing operation for outlier sinks (buffer insertion on 10% of the way between source and sink). 
- ``-distance_between_buffers`` is the distance (in micron) between buffers that TritonCTS should use when creating the tree. When using this parameter, the clock tree algorithm is simplified, and only uses a fraction of the segments from the LUT.
- ``-branching_point_buffers_distance`` is the distance (in micron) that a branch has to have in order for a buffer to be inserted on a branch end-point. This requires the ``-distance_between_buffers`` value to be set.
- ``-clustering_exponent`` is a value that determines the power used on the difference between sink and means on the CKMeans clustering algorithm. If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the default value (4).
- ``-clustering_unbalance_ratio`` is a value that determines the maximum capacity of each cluster during CKMeans. A value of 50% means that each cluster will have extacly half of all sinks for a specific region (half for each branch). If this parameter is omitted, the code gets the default value (0.6).
- ``-sink_clustering_enable`` enables pre-clustering of sinks to create one level of sub-tree before building H-tree. Each cluster is driven by buffer which becomes end point of H-tree structure.
- ``-sink_clustering_size`` specifies the maximum number of sinks per cluster. Default value is 50.
- ``sink_clustering_max_diameter`` specifies maximum diameter (in micron) of sink cluster.  The default value is 20.
- ``-clk_nets`` is a string containing the names of the clock roots. 
If this parameter is omitted, TritonCTS looks for the clock roots automatically.

Another command available from TritonCTS is ``report_cts``. It is used to extract metrics after a successful ``clock_tree_synthesis`` run. These are: Number of Clock Roots, Number of Buffers Inserted, Number of Clock Subnets, and Number of Sinks.
The following tcl snippet shows how to call ``report_cts``.

```
read_sdc "mysdc.sdc"
set_wire_rc -clock -layer metal5
clock_tree_synthesis -root_buf "BUF_X4" \
                     -buf_list "BUF_X4" \
                     -wire_unit 20 

report_cts
```

Argument description:
- ``-out_file`` is the file containing the TritonCTS reports.
If this parameter is omitted, the metrics are shown on the standard output.
