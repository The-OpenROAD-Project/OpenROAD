[INFO ODB-0128] Design: test_no_clk
[INFO ODB-0131]     Created 2 components and 8 component-terminals.
[INFO ODB-0133]     Created 1 nets and 2 connections.
[INFO CTS-0050] Root buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0051] Sink buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0052] The following clock buffers will be used for CTS:
                    CLKBUF_X3
[INFO CTS-0049] Characterization buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0039] Number of created patterns = 840.

[WARNING CTS-0043] 280 wires are pure wire and no slew degradation.
TritonCTS forced slew degradation on these wires.
[INFO CTS-0046]     Number of wire segments: 840.
[INFO CTS-0047]     Number of keys in characterization LUT: 168.
[INFO CTS-0048]     Actual min input cap: 1.
[WARNING CTS-0083] No clock nets have been found.
[INFO CTS-0008] TritonCTS found 0 clock nets.
[WARNING CTS-0082] No valid clock nets in the design.
