[INFO ODB-0227] LEF file: Nangate45/Nangate45.lef, created 22 layers, 27 vias, 135 library cells
Created 231 sinks total
Each group has 10 sinks symmetrically placed + 1 sink at centroid
The centroid sink causes collision with cluster buffer
[INFO CTS-0050] Root buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0051] Sink buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0052] The following clock buffers will be used for CTS:
                    CLKBUF_X3
[INFO CTS-0049] Characterization buffer is CLKBUF_X3.
[INFO CTS-0007] Net "clk" found for clock "clk".
[INFO CTS-0010]  Clock net "clk" has 231 sinks.
[INFO CTS-0008] TritonCTS found 1 clock nets.
[INFO CTS-0097] Characterization used 1 buffer(s) types.
