OpenDP: Open-Source Detailed Placement Engine

Features:

-   Fence region.
-   Fragmented ROWs.

## Commands

The `detailed_placement` command performs detailed placement of instances
to legal locations after global placement.

```
set_placement_padding -global|-instances insts|-masters masters
                      [-left pad_left] [-right pad_right]
detailed_placement [-max_displacement disp|{disp_x disp_y}]
check_placement [-verbose]
filler_placement [-prefix prefix] filler_masters
remove_fillers
optimize_mirroring
```

The `set_placement_padding` command sets left and right padding in multiples
of the row site width. Use the `set_placement_padding` command before
legalizing placement to leave room for routing. Use the `-global` flag
for padding that applies to all instances. Use  `-instances`
for instance-specific padding.  The instances `insts` can be a list of instance
names, or an instance object returned by the SDC `get_cells` command. To
specify padding for all instances of a common master, use the `-filter`
"ref_name == <name>" option to `get_cells`.

The `-max_displacement` argument to `detailed_placement` specifies how
far an instance can be moved when finding a site where it can be placed. The default values are
`{500 100}` sites. The x/y displacement arguments are in microns.

The `check_placement` command checks the placement legality. It returns
`0` if the placement is legal.

The `optimize_mirroring` command mirrors instances about the Y axis in
a weak attempt to reduce total wirelength (HPWL).

The `filler_placement` command fills gaps between detail-placed instances
to connect the power and ground rails in the rows. `filler_masters` is a
list of master/macro names to use for filling the gaps. Wildcard matching
is supported, so `FILL*` will match, e.g., `FILLCELL_X1 FILLCELL_X16 FILLCELL_X2
FILLCELL_X32 FILLCELL_X4 FILLCELL_X8`.  To specify a different naming prefix
from `FILLER_` use `-prefix <new prefix>`.
