# Clock gating

This module provides automatic insertion of clock gates for reducing power usage.
It uses ABC for proving correctness of gating conditions.

The process is roughly:
1. For each register:
  a. Gather nets connected to the register via BFS (limited to 100 nets for performance, user configurable).
     If it encounters a register, it doesn't go through it; it stops there and goes in different directions.
  b. Check if a previously accepted gating condition can be reused; if so, add this register to that condition's list of registers.
  c. Export the network gathered in (a) to ABC.
  d. Check if all the nets in the exported network can form a correct gating condition using ABC.
     - First, simulation with random stimuli quickly looks for counterexamples.
     - Then, if no counterexample was found, a SAT solver is employed to prove that the gating condition is correct.
     A clock enable condition is checked by ORing the nets, and a clock disable condition by ANDing them.
  e. If the set of all nets doesn't form a correct gating condition, move on to the next register.
     Otherwise:
     - Check if after removing half of the nets the gating condition still works.
     - If so, drop the other half of the nets. Otherwise, recurse into the other half of the nets to minimize that subset.
     - Then, recurse into the first half of the nets to minimize that part.
     This produces a minimal set of nets that form a gating condition (not necessarily optimal).
  f. Add the minimal set of nets with the corresponding gated register to a list of accepted gating conditions.
     First check if it doesn't contain it already; if it does, add the gated register to the pre-existing condition's list of registers.
2. For each accepted gating condition with at least 10 corresponding registers (user-configurable),
   insert a new clock gate that gates the corresponding registers under this condition.

clock_gating
```

## Commands

```{note}
All parameters for clock gating are optional, as indicated by square brackets: `[-param param]`.
```

### Clock gating

```tcl
clock_gating
    [-min_instances min_instances]
    [-max_cover max_cover]
    [-dump_dir dump_dir]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-min_instances` | Minimum number of instances that should be gated by a single clock gate. |
| `-max_cover` | Maximum number of initial gate condition candidate nets per instance. |
| `-dump_dir` | Directory for debug dumps. |

## Example scripts

Example script on running `cgt` for a sample design of `aes` can be found here:

```
./test/aes_nangate45.tcl
```

## Regression tests

There are a set of regression tests in `./test`. For more information, refer to this [section](../../README.md#regression-tests).

Simply run the following script:

```shell
./test/regression
```

## Limitations

Clock gating is currently not available for designs that contain HA and FA cells which are not supported by ABC.
