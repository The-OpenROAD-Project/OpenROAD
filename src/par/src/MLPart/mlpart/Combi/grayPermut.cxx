/* Idea behind the following class:
(see e.g., Trotter, PERM (Algorithm 115), Comm. ACM, 5 (1962))

let size==4; and assume we have g3, a GrayPermPosGen object of size 3; then
the sequence is as follows

2,1,0,g3()+1,0,1,2,g3(),2,1,0,g3()+1,0,1,2,g3(),2,1,...

we define a state as consisting of
    _current (which can be 0,1,2,...);
    _dir (which can be left or right);
    _special (which can indicate g3() or g3()+1 output)

and define the obvious state transitions

we also add _finished flag to track down possible internal errors whereby
not all permutations would be generated (either by the GrayPermPosGen
recursively calling GrayPermPosGen, or by initTable calling GrayPermPosGen)

/*
we basically need fast deranking algorithm
idea: the biggest element moves as follows as .next() is applied:
3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 , etc. (this is the repeated subsequence for _size = 4)
thus, the current permutation's index module (_size*2) uniquely determines the
position of the biggest element in the permutation
the position of the second biggest element is determined by the similar
periodic sequence of the (_size-1) permutations; so all that remains to solve
the problem recursively is the index in the sequence of permutations of the
one-smaller size; this index is obviously equal to the number of RECUR? items
encountered, since they (and only they) cause the one-smaller permutation to
advance further in its own sequence
