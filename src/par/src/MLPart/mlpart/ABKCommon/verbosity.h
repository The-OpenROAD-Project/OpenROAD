//: Click to see more comments for verbosity
//   The goal of standardization of verbosity options
//   is to be able to produce consistent diagnostics
//   when using multiple packages. For example, if you
//   run package B with option "silent" and it uses
//   package A, then package A should also understand
//   "silent".
//
//   Use model: constructors of complicated objects
//              can receive optional parameters.
//              A Verbosity object will be one of them
//              (with default "silent").
//              If an object wishes to write some
//              diagnostics, it first looks at
//              the verbosity level for this type
//              of diagnostics and decides whether
//              to write diags or not.
//
//              Note: ATM stderr/cerr output should
//                    not be affected by class Verbosity
//
//   Class Verbosity stores "verbosity levels"
//   for a variable number of "diagnostic types".
//
//   A verbosity level is an unsigned which tells
//   how much diagnostic output of a given type
//   should be printed to cout. Verbosity level
//   0 means "silent" and the bigger the level,
//   the more output should be printed (level
//   K contains all output of level N if K>=N).
//
//   At present, verbosity levels are required for
//   at least three diagnostic types (see comments
//   in the definition of clas Verbosity). Required
//   diag. types have additional support in
//   class Verbose.
//   Tentative general requirements:  for each type,
//   output with levels < 10^(k+1) should
//   be O(n^k) -  long (wrt the program input).
//
//   Usage: this class can be used as is or as a base class.
//
//   Note: if needed, we can add extensions to handle
//   output to different diagnostic streams
//   (e.g. for each type)
