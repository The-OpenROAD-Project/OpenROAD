//: Maintains all random seeds used by a process.
// Idea:  First time you create a random object, an initial nondeterministic
//       seed (also called the "external seed" is created from system
//       information and logged to seeds.out.
//       Any random object created with a seed of UINT_MAX ("nondeterministic"),
//       and that does not use the snazzy new "local independence" feature,
//       then uses seeds from a sequence starting with the initial value
//       and increasing by 1 with each new nondeterministic random object
//       created.
//
//       If the seed is overridden with a value other than UINT_MAX it is used,
//       and logged to seeds.out .
//
//       However if seeds.in exists, the initial nondeterministic value
//       is taken from the second line of seeds.in rather than the system
//       clock, and subsequent *deterministic* values are taken from successive
//       lines of seeds.in rather than from the value passed.
//
//       If seeds.out is in use or other errors occur trying to create it,
//       a warning is generated that the seeds will not be logged, and
//       the initial nondeterministic seed is printed (which should be
//       sufficient to recreate the run provided that all "deterministic"
//       seeds truly *are* deterministic (e.g. don't depend on external
//       devices).
//
//       You can disable the logging function by calling the static
//       function SeedHandler::turnOffLogging().  This will not disable
//       the ability to override seeding with seeds.in .
// NEW ULTRA-COOL FEATURE: (17 June 1999)
//       You now have the option, which I (Mike) highly recommend,
//       of specifying, instead of a seed, a "local identifier", which
//       is a string that should identify uniquely the random variable
//       (not necessarily the random object) being used.  The suggested
//       format of this string is as follows: If your
//       RNG is called _rng and is a member of MyClass, pass
//       the string "MyClass::_rng".  If it's a local variable
//       called rng in the method MyClass::myMethod(), pass
//       the string "MyClass::myMethod(),_rng".
//
//       SeedHandler will maintain a collection of counters associated
//       with each of these strings.  The sequence of random numbers
//       from a random object will be determined by three things:
//            1) the "external seed" (same as "initial nondeterm seed").
//            2) the "local identifier" (the string described above).
//            3) the counter saying how many RNG objects have previously
//                 been created with the same local identifier.
//       When any one of these changes, the output should be effectively
//       independent of the previous RNG.  Moreover you don't have
//       to worry about your regressions changing simply because someone
//       else's code which you call has changed the number of RNG objects
//       it uses.
// ANOTHER NEW FEATURE (21 February 2001)
//       At times you may wish to control the external seed yourself, e.g.
//       by specifying the seed on the command line, rather than
//       using either seeds.in or the nondeterministic chooser.
//       To enable this, a static method SeedHandler::overrideExternalSeed()
//       has been added.  If you call this method before any random
//       object has been created, you can set the external seed.
//       The file seeds.out will still be created unless you call
//       SeedHandler::turnOffLogging().  If seeds.in exists, it
//       will control -- your call to overrideExternalSeed() will
//       print a warning message and otherwise be ignored.
