Features:

-   Analytic and nonlinear placement algorithm. Solves
    electrostatic force equations using Nesterov's method.
    ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jlu/papers/eplace-todaes14/paper.pdf))
-   Verified with various commercial technologies and research enablements using OpenDB
    (7/14/16/28/45/55/65nm).
-   Verified deterministic solution generation with various compilers and OS.

### Tuning Parameters

- `-timing_driven`: Enable timing-driven mode
- `-routability_driven`: Enable routability-driven mode
- `-skip_initial_place` : Skip the initial placement (BiCGSTAB solving) before Nesterov placement. IP improves HPWL by ~5% on large designs. Equal to '-initial_place_max_iter 0'
- `-incremental` : Enable the incremental global placement. Users would need to tune other parameters (e.g., init_density_penalty) with pre-placed solutions.
- `-bin_grid_count`: set bin grid's counts. Default value is defined by internal heuristic. Allowed values are  `[64,128,256,512,..., int]`.
- `-density`: set target density. Default value is 0.70. Allowed values are `[0-1, float]`.
- `-init_density_penalty`: set initial density penalty. Default value is 8e-5. Allowed values are `[1e-6 - 1e6, float]`.
- `-init_wirelength_coef`: set initial wirelength coefficient. Default value is 0.25. Allowed values are `[unlimited, float]`.
- `-min_phi_coef`: set `pcof_min(µ_k Lower Bound)`. Default value is 0.95. Allowed values are `[0.95-1.05, float]`.
- `-max_phi_coef`: set `pcof_max(µ_k Upper Bound)`. Default value is 1.05. Allowed values are `[1.00-1.20, float]`.
- `-overflow`: set target overflow for termination condition. Default value is 0.1. Allowed values are `[0-1, float]`.
- `-initial_place_max_iter`: set maximum iterations in initial place. Default value is 20. Allowed values are `[0-MAX_INT, int]`.
- `-initial_place_max_fanout`: set net escape condition in initial place when 'fanout >= initial_place_max_fanout'. Default value is 200. Allowed values are `[1-MAX_INT, int]`.
- `-timing_driven_net_reweight_overflow`: set overflow threshold for timing-driven net reweighting. Allowed values are `tcl list of [0-100, int]`.
- `-timing_driven_net_weight_max`: Set the multiplier for the most timing critical nets. Default value is 1.9.
- `-timing_driven_nets_percentage`: Set the percentage of nets that are reweighted in timing-driven mode. Default value is 10. Allowed values are `[0-100, float]`   
- `-verbose_level`: set verbose level for RePlAce. Default value is 1. Allowed values are `[0-5, int]`.
- `-force_cpu`: Force to use the CPU solver even if the GPU is available.
- `tray_weight`: Set the weighting factor for tray cost in flip-flop clustering (recommended to be `[20.0, float]`).    
- `timing_weight`: Set the weighting factor for timing-critical paths in flip-flop clusering (recommended to be `[1.0. float]`).   
- `max_split_size`: The maximum size of a single pointset after running the pointset decomposition algorithm for runtime improvement in flop clustering (to not run pointset decomposition, set as `-1`).  


`-timing_driven` does a virtual `repair_design` to find slacks and
weight nets with low slack. It adjusts the worst slacks (10% by default,
modified with -timing_driven_nets_percentage) using a multiplier (1.9 by
default, modified with `-timing_driven_net_weight_max`). The multiplier
is scaled from the full value for the worst slack, to 1.0 at the
timing_driven_nets_percentage point. Use the `set_wire_rc` command to set
resistance and capacitance of estimated wires used for timing.

## Limitations

## Using the Python interface to gpl

This api tries to stay close to the api defined in C++ class `Replace`
that is located in gpl/include/gpl/Replace.h

When initializing a design, a sequence of Python commands might look like
the following:

    from openroad import Design, Tech
    tech = Tech()
    tech.readLef(...)
    design = Design(tech)
    design.readDef(...)
    gpl = design.getReplace()
    
Here is an example of some options / configurations to the global placer.
(See Replace.h for a complete list)

    gpl.setInitialPlaceMaxIter(iter)
    gpl.setSkipIoMode(skip_io)
    gpl.setTimingDrivenMode(timing_driven)
    gpl.setTimingNetWeightMax(weight)

There are some useful Python functions located in the file
grt/test/grt_aux.py but these are not considered a part of the (final)
api and they may change.
