RePlAce: Advancing Solution Quality and Routability Validation in Global Placement

Features:

-   Analytic and nonlinear placement algorithm. Solves
    electrostatic force equations using Nesterov's method.
    ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jlu/papers/eplace-todaes14/paper.pdf))
-   Verified with various commercial technologies and research enablements using OpenDB
    (7/14/16/28/45/55/65nm).
-   Verified deterministic solution generation with various compilers and OS.
-   Supports Mixed-size placement mode.
-   Supports fast image drawing modes with CImg library.

-   `-timing_driven`: Enable timing-driven mode
    -   `-skip_initial_place` : Skip the initial placement (BiCGSTAB
        solving) before Nesterov placement. IP improves HPWL by ~5% on large
        designs. Equal to '-initial_place_max_iter 0'
    -   `-incremental` : Enable the incremental global placement. Users
        would need to tune other parameters (e.g., init_density_penalty) with
        pre-placed solutions.
-   `-grid_count`: `[64,128,256,512,..., int]`. Default: Defined by internal
    heuristic.

### Tuning Parameters

- `-bin_grid_count`: set bin grid's counts. Default value is defined by internal heuristic. Allowed values are  `[64,128,256,512,..., int]`.
- `-density`: set target density. Default value is 0.70. Allowed values are `[0-1, float]`.
- `-init_density_penalty`: set initial density penalty. Default value is 8e-5. Allowed values are `[1e-6 - 1e6, float]`.
- `-init_wire_length_coef`: set initial wirelength coefficient. Default value is 0.25. Allowed values are `[unlimited, float]`.
- `-min_phi_coef`: set `pcof_min(µ_k Lower Bound)`. Default value is 0.95. Allowed values are `[0.95-1.05, float]`.
- `-max_phi_coef`: set `pcof_max(µ_k Upper Bound)`. Default value is 1.05. Allowed values are `[1.00-1.20, float]`.
- `-overflow`: set target overflow for termination condition. Default value is 0.1. Allowed values are `[0-1, float]`.
- `-initial_place_max_iter`: set maximum iterations in initial place. Default value is 20. Allowed values are `[0-MAX_INT, int]`.
- `-initial_place_max_fanout`: set net escape condition in initial place when 'fanout >= initial_place_max_fanout'. Default value is 200. Allowed values are `[1-MAX_INT, int]`.
- `-verbose_level`: set verbose level for RePlAce. Default value is 1. Allowed values are `[0-5, int]`.


`-timing_driven` does a virtual `repair_design` to find slacks and
weight nets with low slack.  Use the `set_wire_rc` command to set
resistance and capacitance of estimated wires used for timing.
