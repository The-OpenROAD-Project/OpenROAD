# Global Placement

The global placement module in OpenROAD (`gpl`) is based on the open-source
RePlAce tool, from the paper "Advancing Solution Quality and Routability Validation
in Global Placement".

Features:

-   Analytic and nonlinear placement algorithm. Solves
    electrostatic force equations using Nesterov's method.
    ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jlu/papers/eplace-todaes14/paper.pdf))
-   Verified with various commercial technologies and research enablements using OpenDB
    (7/14/16/28/45/55/65nm).
-   Verified deterministic solution generation with various compilers and OS.
-   Supports Mixed-size placement mode.

## Commands

```{note}
- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.
- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.
```

### Global Placement

When using the `-timing_driven` flag, `gpl` does a virtual `repair_design` 
to find slacks and
weight nets with low slack. It adjusts the worst slacks (modified with 
`-timing_driven_nets_percentage`) using a multiplier (modified with 
`-timing_driven_net_weight_max`). The multiplier
is scaled from the full value for the worst slack, to 1.0 at the
`timing_driven_nets_percentage` point. Use the `set_wire_rc` command to set
resistance and capacitance of estimated wires used for timing.

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |

### Useful developer functions

If you are a developer, you might find these useful. More details can be found in the [source file](./src/replace.cpp) or the [swig file](./src/replace.i).

```tcl
# debugging global placement 
global_placement_debug -pause -update -inst -draw_bins -initial

# adds padding and gets global placement uniform target density
get_global_placement_uniform_density -pad_left -pad_right 
```

### Cluster Flops

Cluster single bit flops into multi-bit flops.

```
cluster_flops
    [-tray_weight tray_weight]
    [-timing_weight timing_weight]
    [-max_split_size max_split_size]
```

#### General Arguments

| Switch Name | Description |

## Example Scripts

Example scripts demonstrating how to run `gpl` on a sample design on `core01` as follows:

```shell
./test/core01.tcl
```

## Regression tests

There are a set of regression tests in `./test`. For more information, refer to this [section](../../README.md#regression-tests).

Simply run the following script:

```shell
./test/regression
```

## Limitations

## Using the Python interface to gpl

This API tries to stay close to the API defined in `C++` class `Replace`
that is located [here](include/gpl/Replace.h).

When initializing a design, a sequence of Python commands might look like
the following:

```python
from openroad import Design, Tech
tech = Tech()
tech.readLef(...)
design = Design(tech)
design.readDef(...)
gpl = design.getReplace()
```    

Here is an example of some options / configurations to the global placer.
(See [Replace.h](include/gpl/Replace.h) for a complete list)

```python
gpl.setInitialPlaceMaxIter(iter)
gpl.setSkipIoMode(skip_io)
gpl.setTimingDrivenMode(timing_driven)
gpl.setTimingNetWeightMax(weight)
```

There are some useful Python functions located in the file
[grt_aux.py](test/grt_aux.py) but these are not considered a part of the *final*
API and they may change.
