# Global Placement

The global placement module in OpenROAD (`gpl`) is based on the open-source
RePlAce tool, from the paper "Advancing Solution Quality and Routability Validation
in Global Placement".

Features:

-   Analytic and nonlinear placement algorithm. Solves
    electrostatic force equations using Nesterov's method.
    ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jlu/papers/eplace-todaes14/paper.pdf))
-   Verified with various commercial technologies and research enablements using OpenDB
    (7/14/16/28/45/55/65nm).
-   Verified deterministic solution generation with various compilers and OS.
-   Supports Mixed-size placement mode.

## Commands

```{note}
- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.
- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.
```

### Global Placement

When using the `-timing_driven` flag, `gpl` does a virtual `repair_design` 
to find slacks and
weight nets with low slack. It adjusts the worst slacks (modified with 
`-timing_driven_nets_percentage`) using a multiplier (modified with 
`-timing_driven_net_weight_max`). The multiplier
is scaled from the full value for the worst slack, to 1.0 at the
`timing_driven_nets_percentage` point. Use the `set_wire_rc` command to set
resistance and capacitance of estimated wires used for timing. 

Timing-driven iterations are triggered based on a list of overflow threshold 
values. Each time the placer execution reaches these overflow values, the 
resizer is executed. This process can be costly in terms of runtime. The 
overflow values for recalculating weights can be modified with 
`-timing_driven_net_reweight_overflow`, you may use less overflow threshold 
values to decrease runtime, for example.

When the routability-driven option is enabled, each of its iterations will 
execute RUDY to provide an estimation of routing congestion. Congested tiles 
will have the area of their logic cells inflated to reduce routing congestion. 
The iterations will attempt to achieve the target RC (routing congestion) 
by comparing it to the final RC at each iteration. If the algorithm takes too 
long during routability-driven execution, consider raising the target RC value 
(`-routability_target_rc_metric`) to alleviate the constraints. The final RC 
value is calculated based on the weight coefficients. The algorithm will stop 
if the RC is not decreasing for three consecutive iterations.

#### Routability-Driven Arguments

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-routability_use_grt` | Use this tag to execute routability using FastRoute from grt for routing congestion, which is more precise but has a high runtime cost. By default, routability mode uses RUDY, which is faster. |

| `-routability_max_bloat_iter` | Set bloat iteration threshold for routability mode. The default value is `1`, and the allowed values are integers `[1, MAX_INT]`.|
| `-routability_max_inflation_iter` | Set inflation iteration threshold for routability mode. The default value is `4`, and the allowed values are integers `[1, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-routability_inflation_ratio_coef` | Set inflation ratio coefficient for routability mode. The default value is `5`, and the allowed values are floats. |
| `-routability_max_inflation_ratio` | Set inflation ratio threshold for routability mode to prevent overly aggressive adjustments. The default value is `8`, and the allowed values are floats. |
| `-routability_rc_coefficients` | Set routability RC coefficients for calculating the final RC. They relate to the 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5% most congested tiles. It comes in the form of a Tcl List `{k1, k2, k3, k4}`. The default value for each coefficient is `{1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0}` respectively, and the allowed values are floats. |

#### Timing-Driven Arguments

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-timing_driven_net_reweight_overflow` | Set overflow threshold for timing-driven net reweighting. Allowed value is a Tcl list of integers where each number is `[0, 100]`. Default values are [79, 64, 49, 29, 21, 15] |
| `-timing_driven_net_weight_max` | Set the multiplier for the most timing-critical nets. The default value is `1.9`, and the allowed values are floats. |
| `-timing_driven_nets_percentage` | Set the reweighted percentage of nets in timing-driven mode. The default value is 10. Allowed values are floats `[0, 100]`. |

### Cluster Flops

This command does flop clustering based on parameters.

```tcl
cluster_flops
    [-tray_weight tray_weight]\
    [-timing_weight timing_weight]\
    [-max_split_size max_split_size]\
    [-num_paths num_paths]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-tray_weight` | Tray weight, default value is 32.0, type `float`. |
| `-timing_weight` | Timing weight, default value is 0.1, type `float`. |
| `-max_split_size` | Maximum split size, default value is 500 (-1 for no decomposition), type `int`.|
| `-num_paths` | KIV, default value is 0, type `int`. |


### Debug Mode

The `global_placement_debug` command initiates a debug mode, enabling real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress on the layout. Use the command prior to executing the `global_placement` command, for example in the `global_place.tcl` script.

```tcl
global_placement_debug
    [-pause] 
    [-update]
    [-inst]
    [-draw_bins]
    [-initial]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-pause` | Number of iterations between pauses during debugging. Allows for visualization of the current state. Useful for closely monitoring the progression of the placement algorithm. Allowed values are integers, default is 10. |
| `-update` | Defines the frequency (in iterations) at which the tool refreshes its layout output to display the latest state during debugging. Allowed values are integers, default is 10.  |
| `-inst` | Targets a specific instance name for debugging focus. Allowed value is a string, the default behavior focuses on no specific instance. |
| `-draw_bins` | Activates visualization of placement bins, showcasing their density (indicated by the shade of white) and the direction of forces acting on them (depicted in red). The default setting is disabled. |
| `-initial` | Pauses the debug process during the initial placement phase. The default setting is disabled. |

Example: `global_placement_debug -pause 100 -update 1 -initial -draw_bins -inst _614_`
This command configures the debugger to pause every 100 iterations, with layout updates occurring every iteration. It enables initial placement stage visualization, bin drawing, and specifically highlights instance 614.

## Useful Developer Commands

If you are a developer, you might find these useful. More details can be found in the [source file](./src/replace.cpp) or the [swig file](./src/replace.i).

```
# adds padding and gets global placement uniform target density
get_global_placement_uniform_density -pad_left -pad_right 
```
Example scripts demonstrating how to run `gpl` on a sample design on `core01` as follows:

```shell
./test/core01.tcl
```

## Regression tests

There are a set of regression tests in `./test`. For more information, refer to this [section](../../README.md#regression-tests).

Simply run the following script:

```shell
./test/regression
```

## Limitations

## Using the Python interface to gpl

This API tries to stay close to the API defined in `C++` class `Replace`
that is located [here](include/gpl/Replace.h).

When initializing a design, a sequence of Python commands might look like
the following:

```python
from openroad import Design, Tech
tech = Tech()
tech.readLef(...)
design = Design(tech)
design.readDef(...)
gpl = design.getReplace()
```    

Here is an example of some options / configurations to the global placer.
(See [Replace.h](include/gpl/Replace.h) for a complete list)

```python
gpl.setInitialPlaceMaxIter(iter)
gpl.setSkipIoMode(skip_io)
gpl.setTimingDrivenMode(timing_driven)
gpl.setTimingNetWeightMax(weight)
```

There are some useful Python functions located in the file
[grt_aux.py](test/grt_aux.py) but these are not considered a part of the *final*
API and they may change.
