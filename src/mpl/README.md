# Hierarchical Macro Placement

A hierarchical automatic macro placer for large-scale complex IP blocks, "Hier-RTLMP".
This tool builds on the existing RTLMP (`mpl`) framework, adopting a multilevel physical 
planning approach that exploits the hierarchy and data flow inherent in the design RTL.

## Commands

```{note}
- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.
- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-max_num_macro`, `-min_num_macro` | Maximum/minimum number of macros in a cluster. The default value is `0` for both, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-max_num_inst`, `-min_num_inst` | Maximum/minimum number of standard cells in a cluster. The default value is `0` for both, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-tolerance` | Add a margin to the minimum and maximum number of macros/std cells in a cluster. For min, we multiply by (1 - `tol`), and for the max (1 + `tol`). This is to improve the robustness of hierarchical clustering. The allowed values are floats `[0, 1)`, and the default value is `0.1`. |
| `-max_num_level` | Maximum depth of physical hierarchical tree. The default value is `2`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-coarsening_ratio` | The larger the coarsening_ratio, the faster the convergence process. The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `10.0`. |
| `-large_net_threshold` | Ignore nets with many connections during clustering, such as global nets. The default value is `50`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-halo_width` | Horizontal/vertical halo around macros (microns). The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `0.0`. |
| `-fence_lx`, `-fence_ly`, `-fence_ux`, `-fence_uy` | Defines the global fence bounding box coordinates. The default values are the core area coordinates). |
| `-target_util` | Specifies the target utilization. The allowed values are floats and the default value is `0.25`. |
| `-min_ar` | Specifies the minimum aspect ratio $a$, or the ratio of its width to height of a `StandardCellCluster` from $[a, \frac{1}{a}]$. The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `0.33`. |
| `-report_directory` | Save reports to this directory. |
| `-write_macro_placement` | Generates a file with the design's macro placement in the format of calls for the `place_macro` command. |
| `-keep_clustering_data` | Save the hierarchy generated by MPL's clustering engine in the form of dbGroups inside ODB. |

#### Simulated Annealing Weight parameters

Do note that while action probabilities are normalized to 1.0, the weights are not necessarily normalized. 

| Switch Name | Description | 
| ----- | ----- |
| `-area_weight` | Weight for the area of current floorplan.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `0.1`. |
| `-outline_weight` | Weight for violating the fixed outline constraint, meaning that all clusters should be placed within the shape of their parent cluster.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `100.0`. |
| `-wirelength_weight` | Weight for half-perimeter wirelength.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `100.0`. |
| `-guidance_weight` | Weight for guidance cost or clusters being placed near specified regions if users provide such constraints.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `10.0`. |
| `-fence_weight` | Weight for fence cost, or how far the macro is from zero fence violation.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `10.0`. |
| `-boundary_weight` | Weight for the boundary, or how far the hard macro clusters are from boundaries. Note that mixed macro clusters are not pushed, thus not considered in this cost.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `50.0`. |
| `-notch_weight` | Weight for the notch, or the existence of dead space that cannot be used for placement & routing. Note that this cost applies only to hard macro clusters.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `10.0`. |
| `-macro_blockage_weight` | Weight for macro blockage, or the overlapping instances of the macro.  The allowed values are floats, and the default value is `10.0`. |

### Place Macro

Command for manual placement of a single macro.

```tcl
place_macro
    -macro_name macro_name
    -location {x y}
    [-orientation orientation]
    [-exact]
    [-allow_overlap]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-macro_name` | The name of a macro of the design. |
| `-location` | The lower left corner of the macro in microns. |
| `-orientation` | The orientation according to odb. If nothing is specified, defaults to `R0`.  We only allow `R0`, `MY`, `MX` and `R180`.  |
| `-exact` | Enforce the exact `-location`. Note that the default behavior of `place_macro` is to snap the macro, that is, tune the entered `-location` so that the signal pins get aligned with the track-grid. |
| `-allow_overlap` | Allow the macro to be placed even if it overlaps with other macros. Note that the default behavior is to only place the macro if no overlap with other macros is found. |

### Set Macro Guidance Region

Command for setting guidance regions for macros. The guidance region can have any size as long it fits inside the core area, as the placer will try to
maximize the overlap region between macro and guidance region.

```tcl
set_macro_guidance_region
    -macro_name macro_name
    -region region
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-macro_name` | The name of a macro of the design. |
| `-region` | The lower left corner and upper right corner {lx ly ux uy} of the region in microns. |


### Set Macro Halo

Command for setting a halo for specific macros. If unset, the macro will use the default values specified in MACRO_PLACE_HALO.

```tcl
set_macro_halo
    -macro_name macro_name
    -halo {width height}
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-macro_name` | The name of a macro of the design. |
| `-halo` | The width and height of the halo, in microns. |

## Example scripts

Example of a script demonstrating how to run `mpl` on a sample design of `bp_fe_top` as follows:

```shell
./test/bp_fe_top.tcl
```

## Regression tests

There are a set of regression tests in `./test`. For more information, refer to this [section](../../README.md#regression-tests).

Simply run the following script:

```shell
./test/regression
```
