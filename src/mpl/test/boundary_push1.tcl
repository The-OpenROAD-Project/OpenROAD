# Four ungrouped macros, centralized by the floorplan centralization
# inside SA and pushed to all corners of the core by the Pusher.
#
# Observations:
#   1. The IO pins are needed to avoid the only-macro special corner case.
#   2. The boundary weight must be manually set to zero in order
#      to prevent the floorplan centralization revert.
