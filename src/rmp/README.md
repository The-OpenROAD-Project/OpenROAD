# Restructure

The restructure module in OpenROAD (`rmp`) is based on an interface to ABC for
local resynthesis. The package allows logic restructuring that targets area or
timing. It extracts a cloud of logic to ABC using the [`cut`](../cut/README.md)
module. Multiple recipes for area or timing are run to obtain multiple
structures from ABC; the most desirable among these is used to improve the
netlist. The resynthesized logic is then read back to OpenDB. Reading back of
constants requires insertion of tie cells which should be provided by the user
as per the interface described below.

## Commands

```{note}
- Parameters in square brackets `[-param param]` are optional.
- Parameters without square brackets `-param2 param2` are required.
```

### Restructure

Restructuring can be done in two modes: area or delay.

- Method 1: Area Mode
Example: `restructure -liberty_file ckt.lib -target area -tielo_pin ABC -tiehi_pin DEF`

- Method 2: Timing Mode
Example: `restructure -liberty_file ckt.lib -target delay -tielo_pin ABC -tiehi_pin DEF -slack_threshold 1 -depth_threshold 2` 

```tcl
restructure 
    [-slack_threshold slack_val]
    [-depth_threshold depth_threshold]
    [-target area|delay]
    [-abc_logfile logfile]
    [-liberty_file liberty_file]
    [-tielo_port  tielo_pin_name]
    [-tiehi_port tiehi_pin_name]
    [-work_dir work_dir]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-liberty_file` | Liberty file with description of cells used in design. This is passed to ABC. |
| `-target` | Either `area` or `delay`. In area mode, the focus is area reduction, and timing may degrade. In delay mode, delay is likely reduced, but the area may increase. The default value is `area`. |
| `-slack_threshold` | Specifies a (setup) timing slack value below which timing paths need to be analyzed for restructuring. The default value is `0`, and the allowed values are floats `[0, MAX_FLOAT]`. |
| `-depth_threshold` | Specifies the path depth above which a timing path would be considered for restructuring. The default value is `16`, and the allowed values are `[0, MAX_INT]`. |
| `-tielo_pin` | Tie cell pin that can drive constant zero. The format is `<cell>/<port>`. |
| `-tiehi_pin` | Tie cell pin that can drive constant one. The format is `<cell>/<port>`. |
| `-abc_logfile` | Output file to save abc logs to. |
| `-work_dir` | Name of the working directory for temporary files. If not provided, `run` directory would be used. |

### Resynth

Resynthesize parts of the design in an attempt to fix negative slack.

```tcl
resynth
    [-corner corner]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-corner` | Process corner to use. |

### Resynth with simulated annealing

Resynthesize parts of the design with an ABC script found via simulated annealing.
The script is a series of operations on ABC's internal AIG data structure.
A neighboring solution is a script with one operation added, removed, or two operations swapped.
The optimization function is defined as the worst slack.

```tcl
resynth_annealing
    [-corner corner]
    [-slack_threshold slack_threshold]
    [-seed seed]
    [-temp temp]
    [-iters iters]
    [-revert_after revert_after]
    [-initial_ops initial_ops]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-corner` | Process corner to use. |
| `-slack_threshold` | Specifies a (setup) timing slack value below which timing paths need to be analyzed for restructuring. The default value is `0`. |
| `-seed` | Seed to use for randomness in simulated annealing. |
| `-temp` | Initial temperature for simulated annealing. The default is the required arrival time on the worst slack endpoint. |
| `-iters` | Number of iterations to run simulated annealing for. |
| `-revert_after` | After the given number of iterations that worsen slack, revert to best found solution. |
| `-initial_ops` | Size of the initial random solution (number of commands in the script for ABC). |

## Example scripts

Example scripts on running `rmp` for a sample design of `gcd` as follows:

```
./test/gcd_restructure.tcl
```

## Regression tests

There are a set of regression tests in `./test`. For more information, refer to this [section](../../README.md#regression-tests).

Simply run the following script:

```shell
./test/regression
```
