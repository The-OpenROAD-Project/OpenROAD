# Flute3

Flute3 is an open-source rectilinear Steiner minimum tree heuristic with
improvements made by UFRGS students and James Cherry. This tool is used
for the calculation of wirelength in `grt` and `rsz`. 

The version in this repository uses
CMake and C++ namespace, and has dynamic memory allocation. Flute3 can handle nets with any degree.
