# Model Generation Flow for rcx using Open Source Field Solver FasterCap

        Create Wire patterns that can be used by field solvers to simulate and analyze electrical properties, 
	starting with a full process stack conductors and dielectrics.
	These patterns contain the conductors and dielectrics for a full simulation
	Since the dielectric and conductor dimensions and constant dielectric epsilon values are dependent on the process stack
	the wire pattern needs to be generate for each process

	The following scripts make the process automatic

	Field Solver Conversion: UniversalFormat2FasterCap_923.py 

        	Development of a conversion tool that translates RCX output into formats readable by FasterCap, 
			streamlining the integration of various field solver tools.

	Wrapper Script to run FasterCap for Pattern Sets: run_fasterCap.bash

        	Run FasterCap for Pattern Sets
        	Automating the process of running FasterCap for generated patterns through a unified script, 
			reducing manual intervention and allow for targeting group of patterns, optionally.
		Incremental since FasterCap can run for hours and can be interupted
		Includes time limit mechanism for long FasterCap runs

	FasterCap to RC Converter: fasterCapParse.py

        	Develop a conversion tool that translates FasterCap results back into RCX row fformat, ensuring compatibility with existing RCX flows.


        Model File Generation in RCX

		Tcl commands can read results from the fasterCap Parser and create the model
