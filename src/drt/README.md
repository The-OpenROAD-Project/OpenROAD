# TritonRoute

TritonRoute is an open-source detailed router for modern industrial
designs. The router consists of several main building blocks, including
pin access analysis, track assignment, initial detailed routing,
search and repair, and a DRC engine. The initial development of the
[router](https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/363/c363.pdf)
is inspired by the [ISPD-2018 initial detailed routing
contest](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/18/).  However, the current framework
differs and is built from scratch, aiming for an industrial-oriented scalable
and flexible flow.

TritonRoute provides industry-standard LEF/DEF interface with
support of [ISPD-2018](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/18/) and
[ISPD-2019](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/19/) contest-compatible route
guide format.
