# OpenROAD-pdn

This utility aims to simplify the process of adding a power grid into a floorplan.
The aim is to specify a small set of power grid policies to be applied to the design, such as layers to use,
stripe width and spacing, then have the utility generate the actual metal straps. Grid policies can be defined
over the stdcell area, and over areas occupied by macros.
