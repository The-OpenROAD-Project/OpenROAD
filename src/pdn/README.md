# PDNGEN

This utility aims to simplify the process of adding a power grid into a
floorplan. The aim is to specify a small set of power grid policies to be
applied to the design, such as layers to use, stripe width and spacing,
then have the utility generate the actual metal straps. Grid policies can
be defined over the stdcell area, and over areas occupied by macros.

The -name argument is used to define a name for the voltage domain that can be used in the `define_pdn_grid` command
The -power and -ground arguments are used to define the names of the nets to be use for power and ground respectively within this voltage domain.

If the voltage domain is a switched power domain, then the name of the swiched power net must be specified with the -switched_power option.

```

#### Options

| `-obstructions` | Specify the layers to add routing blockages, in order to avoid DRC violations |

```

### Power switch insertion

```
define_pdn_grid [-name <name>] \
                [-switch_cell <power_switch_cell_name> ] \
                [-power_control <power_constrol_signal_name>] \
                [-power_control_network (STAR|DAISY)]
```

#### Options

| Switch Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `-switch_cell` | Defines the name of the coarse grain power switch cell to be used for this grid. |
| `-power_control` | Defines the name of the power control signal used to control the switching of the inserted power switches. |
| `-power_control_network` | Defines the structure of the power control signal network. Choose from STAR, or DAISY |


The `-switch_cell` argument is used to specify the name of a coarse-grain power switch cell that is to be inserted whereever the stdcell rail connects to the rest of the power grid. The mesh layers are associated with the unswitched power net of the voltage domain, whereas the stdcell rail is associated with the switched power net of the voltage domain. The placement of a power switch cell connects the unswitched power mesh to the switched power rail through a power switch defined by the `define_power_switch_cell` command.

The `-power_control` argument specifies the name of the power control signal that must be connected to the inserted power control cells.

The `-power_control_network` argument specifies how the power control signal is to be connected to the power switches. If STAR is specified, then the network is wired as a high-fanout net with the power control signal driving the power control pin on every power switch. If DAISY is specified then the power switches are connected in a daisy-chain configuration - note, this requires that the power swich defined by the `define_power_switch_cell`  command defines an acknowledge pin for the switch.

### Add straps / stripes

Defines a pattern of power and ground stripes in a single layer to be added to a power grid.

```
add_pdn_stripe [-grid grid_name] \
                -layer layer_name \
                -width width_value \
                [-pitch pitch_value] \

add pdn_stripe -grid main_grid -layer metal4 -width 0.48 -pitch 56.0 -offset 2 -starts_with GROUND
```

### Add rings

The `add_pnd_ring` command is used to define power/ground rings around a grid region. The ring structure is built using two layers that are orthogonal to each other. A power/ground pair will be added above and below the grid using the horizontal layer, with another power/ground pair to the left and right using the vertical layer. Together these 4 pairs of power/ground stripes form a ring around the specified grid. Power straps on these layers that are inside the enclosed region are extend to connect to the ring.

```
add_pdn_ring [-grid grid_name] \
             -layers layer_name \
             -widths (width_value|list_of_2_values) \
             -spacings (spacing_value|list_of_2_values) \

During power grid generation, vias will be added for overlapping power nets and overlapping ground nets. The use of fixed vias from the technology file can be specified or else via stacks will be constructed using VIARULEs. If VIARULEs are not available in the technology, then fixed vias must be used.

```
add_pdn_connect [-grid grid_name] \
                [-layers list_of_two_layers] \
                [-cut_pitch pitch_value] \
                [-fixed_vias list_of_fixed_vias] \

### Sroute

The `add_sroute_connect` command is employed for connecting pins located
outside of a specific power domain to the power ring, especially in cases where
multiple power domains are present. During `sroute`, multi-cut vias will be added
for new connections. The use of fixed vias from the technology file should be
specified for the connection using the `add_sroute_connect` command. The use
of max_rows and max_columns defines the row and column limit for the via stack.

add_sroute_connect
    -layers list_of_2_layers
    -cut_pitch pitch_value
    [-net net]
    [-outerNet outerNet]
