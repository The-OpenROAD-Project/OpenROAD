    -pin_pattern pin_regular_expression \
    (-power|-ground)
```

## Description
The `add_global_connection` command is used to connect power and ground pins on design instances to the appropriate supplies.

## Options

| Switch Name | Description |

```
# Stdcell power/ground pins
add_global_connection -net VDD -pin_pattern {^VDD$} -power
add_global_connection -net VSS -pin_pattern {^VSS$} -ground

# RAM power ground pins
add_global_connection -net VDD -pin_pattern {^VDDPE$}
add_global_connection -net VDD -pin_pattern {^VDDCE$}
add_global_connection -net VSS -pin_pattern {^VSSE$}
