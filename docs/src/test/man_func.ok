NAME
       openroad - OpenROAD command-line-interface.

SYNOPSIS
       openroad	 [-help]  [-version]  [-no_init]  [-no_splash]	[-exit] [-gui]
       [-threads count|max] [-log file_name]  [-metrics	 file_name]  [-python]
       cmd_file

DESCRIPTION
       The  openroad  command  is  the command-line interface for OpenROAD, an
       open-source initiative for chip design and optimization.	 It provides a
       range of options to control its behavior and execute commands specified
       in the cmd_file.

OPTIONS
       -help: Display help information.

       -version: Display version information.

       -no_init: Skip initialization steps.

       -no_splash: Do not show the license splash at startup.

       -exit: Exit after executing commands in cmd_file.

       -gui: Launch the graphical user interface (GUI).

       -threads	 count|max: Specify the number of threads to use (or  use  max
       available).

       -log file_name: Log output to the specified file.

       -metrics file_name: Save performance metrics to the specified file.

       -python: Execute the cmd_file as a Python script.

ARGUMENTS
       cmd_file: The command file containing OpenROAD commands to be executed.

EXAMPLES
       openroad -help: Prints the help information

       openroad	 -version -exit: Prints the version information, and exits the
       program thereafter.

       openroad -threads max -log test.log -metrics test.metrics:  Prints  the
       log  and	 metric	 respectively to test.log and test.metrics.  Also runs
       the script with maximum available number of threads.

       openroad -gui: Launches OpenROAD GUI,  which  further  interactive  Tcl
       commands can be run.

TCL COMMANDS
       These Tcl-based commands are callable from within the OpenROAD binary.

	 • Read Library Exchange Format (.lef) files.

	 • tech: Technology-specific information
