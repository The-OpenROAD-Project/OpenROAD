Using the logging infrastructure
================================

In order to ensure consistent messaging from the openroad application we
have adopted spdlog as our logging infrastructure. We have a thin
wrapper on top for extensibility. Whenever a message needs to be issued
you will use one of the logging functions in the ‘ord’ namespace.

All output from OpenROAD tools should be directed through the logging
API so that redirection, file logging and execution control flow is
handled consistently.

The logging infrastructure also supports generating a `JSON
<https://www.json.org>`__ file containing design metrics (e.g. area,
slack). This output is directed to a user specified file. The openroad
application take a "-metrics " command line argument to specify the file.

Message Types
-------------

Report
~~~~~~

Reports are tool output in the form of a report to the user. Examples
are timing paths, or power analysis results. Tool reports that use
‘printf’ or c++ streams should use the report message API instead.

Debug
~~~~~

Debug messages are only of use to tool developers and not to end users.
These messages are not shown unless explicitly enabled.

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~

Information messages may be used for reporting metrics, quality of
results, or program status to the user. Any messages which indicate
runtime problems, such as potential faulty input or other internal
program issues, should be issued at a higher status level.

Example messages for this status level:

::

   Number of input ports: 47
   Running optimization iteration 2
   Current cell site utilization: 57.1567%

Warning
~~~~~~~

Warnings should be used for indicating atypical runtime conditions that
may affect quality, but not correctness of the output. Any conditions
that affect correctness should be issued at a higher status level.

Example warning messages:

::

   Core area utilization is greater than 90%. The generated cell placement may not be routable.
   14 outputs are not constrained for max capacitance.
   Pin ‘A[0]’ on instance ‘mem01’ does not contain antenna information and will not be checked for antenna violations.

Error
~~~~~

Error messages should be used for indicating correctness problems.
Problems with command arguments are a good example of errors. Errors
exit the current command by throw an error that can be caught in a Tcl
command script. Errors that occur while reading a command file stop
executing the script commands.

Example error messages:

::

   Invalid selection: net ‘test0’ does not exist in the design.
   Cell placement cannot be run before floorplanning.
   Argument ‘max_routing_layer’ expects an integer value from 1 to 10.

Critical
~~~~~~~~

Critical messages should be used for indicating correctness problems
that the program is not able to work around or ignore, and require
immediate exiting of the program (abort).

Example critical messages:

::

   Database ‘chip’ has been corrupted and is not recoverable.
   Unable to allocate heap memory for array ‘vertexIndices’. The required memory size may exceed host machine limits.
   Assertion failed: ‘nodeVisited == false’ on line 122 of example.cpp. Please file a Github issue and attach a testcase.

Coding
------

Each status message requires: \* The three letter tool ID \* The message
ID \* The message string \* Optionally, additional arguments to fill in
placeholders in the message string

Reporting is simply printing and does not require a tool or message ID.
The tool ID comes from a fixed enumeration of all the tools in the
system. This enumeration is in ``Logger.h``. New abbreviations should be
added after discussion with the system architects. The abbreviation
matches the c++ namespace for the tool.

Message IDs are integers. They are expected to be unique for each tool.
This has the benefit that a message can be mapped to the source code
unambiguously even if the text is not unique. Maintaining this invariant
is the tool owner’s responsibility. To ensure that the IDs are unique
each tool should maintain a file named ‘messages.txt’ in the top level
tool directory listing the message IDs along with the format string.
When code that uses a message ID is removed the ID should be retired by
removing it from ‘messages.txt’. See the tuility
``etc/find_messages.py`` to scan a tool directory and write a
``messages.txt`` file.

Spdlog comes with the fmt library which supports message formatting in a
python / `c++20 like
style <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/formatter#Standard_format_specification>`__.

The message string should not include the tool ID or message ID which
will automatically be prepended. A trailing new line will automatically
be added so messages should not end with one. Messages should be written
as complete sentences and end in a period. Multi-line messages may
contain embedded new lines.

Some examples:

::

   logger->report(“Path startpoint: {}”, startpoint);
   logger->error(ODB, 25, “Unable to open LEF file {}.”, file_name);
   logger->info(DRT, 42, “Routed {} nets in {:3.2f}s.”, net_count, elapsed_time);

Tcl functions for reporting messages are defined in the OpenRoad swig
file OpenRoad.i. The message is simply a Tcl string (no c++20
formatting). The logger for Tcl functions The above examples in Tcl are
shown below.

::

   utl::report “Path startpoint: $startpoint”
   utl::error ODB 25 “Unable to open LEF file $file_name.”
   utl::info DRT 42 “Routed $net_count nets in [format %3.2f $elapsed_time].”

``utl::report`` should be used instead of ‘puts’ so that all output is
logged.

Calls to the Tcl functions utl::warn and utl::error with a single
message argument report with tool ID “UKN” and message ID 0000.

Tools ``#include utl/Logger.h`` that defines the logger API. The
Logger instance is owned by the OpenRoad instance. Each tool should
retrieve the logger instance in the tool init function called after the
tool make function by the OpenRoad application.

Every tool swig file must include src/Exception.i so that errors thrown
by utl::error are caught at the Tcl command level. Use the following
swig command before %inline.

::

   %include "../../Exception.i"

The logger functions are shown below.

::

   Logger::report(const std::string& message,
                  const Args&... args)
   Logger::info(ToolId tool,
                int id,
                const std::string& message,
                const Args&... args)
   Logger::warn(ToolId tool,
                int id,
                const std::string& message,
                const Args&... args)
   Logger::error(ToolId tool,
                 int id,
                 const std::string& message,
                 const Args&... args)
   Logger::critical(ToolId tool,
                    int id,
                    const std::string& message,
                    const Args&... args)

The corresponding Tcl functions are shown below.

::

   utl::report message
   utl::info tool id message
   utl::warn tool id message
   utl::error tool id message
   utl::critical tool id message

Although there is a utl::critical function, it is really difficult to
imagine any circumstances that would justify aborting execution of the
application in a tcl function.

Debug Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The debug message have a different programming model. As they are most
often *not* issued the concern is to avoid slowing down normal
execution. For this reason such messages are issued by using the
debugPrint macro. This macro will avoid evaluating its arguments if they
are not going to be printed. The API is:

::

   debugPrint(logger, tool, group, level, message, ...)

The debug() method of the Logger class should not be called directly. No
message id is used as these messages are not intended for end users. The
level is printed as the message id in the output.

The argument types are as for the info/warn/error/ciritical messages.
The one additional argument is group which is a `const char*`. Its
purposes is to allow the enabling of subsets of messages within one
tool.

Debug messages are enabled with the tcl command: `set_debug_level <tool> <group> <level>`

Metrics
-------

The metrics logging uses a more restricted API since JSON only supports
specific types. There are a set of overloaded methods of the form:

::

   metric(ToolId tool,
          const std::string_view metric,
          <type> value)

where <type> can be int, double, string, or bool. This will result in
the generated JSON:

::

     "<tool>-<metric>" : value

String values will be enclosed in double-quotes automatically.

Converting to Logger
--------------------

The error functions in ``include/openroad/Error.hh`` should no longer be
included or used. Use the corresponding logger functions.

All uses of the tcl functions ord::error and ord::warn should be updated
call the utl::error/warn with a Tool ID and message ID. For
compatibility these are defaulted to 'UKN' and '0000' until they are
updated.

There is no reason to ``puts`` (ie, print) errors in regression tests
that are caught. The logger prints the error now.

Init floorplan, openroad/src, init floorplan, dbSta, resizer, and opendp
have been updated to use the Logger if you need examples of how to
initialize and use it.

Regression tests should not have any ``UKN-0000`` messages in their ok
files. A simple grep should indicate that you still have pending calls
to pre-logger error/warn functions. \`

The cmake file for the tool must also be updated to include spdlog in
the link libraries so it can find the header files if they are not in
the normal system directories. dfm is an example of this problem; it has
an ancient version of spdlog in '/usr/include/spdlog'. Use module to
install spdlog 1.8.1 on dfm and check your build there.
