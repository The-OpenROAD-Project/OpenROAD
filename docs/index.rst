Welcome to OpenROAD's documentation!
====================================

The OpenROAD ("Foundations and Realization of Open, Accessible Design") project
was launched in June 2018 within the DARPA IDEA program. OpenROAD aims to bring
down the barriers of cost, expertise and unpredictability that currently block
designers' access to hardware implementation in advanced technologies. The
project team (Qualcomm, Arm and multiple universities and partners, led by UC
San Diego) is developing a fully autonomous, open-source tool chain for digital
layout generation across die, package and board, with initial focus on the
RTL-to-GDSII phase of system-on-chip design. Thus, OpenROAD holistically attacks
the multiple facets of today's design cost crisis: engineering resources, design
tool licenses, project schedule, and risk.

The IDEA program targets no-human-in-loop (NHIL) design, with 24-hour turnaround
time and zero loss of power-performance-area (PPA) design quality.

The NHIL target requires tools to adapt and auto-tune successfully to flow completion
without or with significantly minimal human intervention. Machine intelligence augments 
human expertise through efficient modeling and prediction of flow outcomes during layout generation.

24 hours runtime target implies that problems must be strategically decomposed into optimal partitions
during the design process through intellgient distribution and management of computational
resources. This ensures that the design constraints are met for schedule, performance
and cost. Any quality loss due to decomposition that uses a parallel and distributed search
over cloud resources, is subsequently recovered through improved flow predictability and enhanced optimization.
