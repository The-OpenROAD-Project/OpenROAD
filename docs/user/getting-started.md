# Getting Started

## Get the tools
There are currently two options to get OpenROAD tools.

### Option 1: download pre-build binaries

We currently support pre-built binaries on CentOS 7. Please, refer to the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow/releases).

### Option 2: build from sources

OpenROAD is divided into a number of tools that are orchestrated together to achieve RTL-to-GDS.
As of the current implementation, the flow is divided into three stages:

1. Logic Synthesis: is performed by [yosys](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/yosys).
2. Floorplanning through Global Routing: are performed by [OpenROAD App](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD).
3. Detailed Routing: is performed by [TritonRoute](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute).

In order to integrate the flow steps, 
[OpenROAD-flow](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow) repository includes the necessary scripts to build and test the flow.

**Prerequisites**

Build dependencies are documented in the Dockerfile of each tool.
1. See [yosys Dockerfile](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/yosys/blob/master/Dockerfile)
2. See [OpenROAD App Dockerfile](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/Dockerfile)
3. See [TritonRoute Dockerfile](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute/blob/master/Dockerfile)

Before proceeding to the next step:
1. [recommended] Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/) on your machine, OR
2. [bare-metal] Make sure that build dependencies for all the tools are installed on your machine.

**Clone and build**

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow
./build_openroad.sh
```
The build script will automatically use Docker builds if it finds `docker` command installed on the system.

### Verify Installation

Setup environment:

1. `./setup_env.sh` if the build was done using Docker.
2. `./setup_env_bare_metal_build.sh` if the build was done on the bare-metal.

**Verify**

The following binaries should be available on your `$PATH` after setting up the environment

- `yosys -h`
- `openroad -h`
- `TritonRoute -h`


## Setting up the Flow

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow
cd OpenROAD-flow/flow
```

2. Setup your shell environment. The `openroad` app must be setup to implement designs or run tests. See setup
   instructions in the repository *Verify Installation* section above.


## Designs
Sample design configurations are available in the `designs` directory. You can
select a design using either of the following methods:
1. The flow [Makefile](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow/blob/master/flow/Makefile) contains a list of sample design configurations
   at the top of the file. Uncomment the respective line to select the design
2. Specify the design using the shell environment, e.g.
   `make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/nangate45/swerv.mk` or
   `export DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/nangate45/swerv.mk; make`

By default, the simple design gcd is selected. We recommend implementing this
design first to validate your flow and tool setup.

### Adding a New Design
To add a new design, we recommend looking at the included designs for examples
of how to set one up.

:warning: Please refer to the known issues and limitations
[document](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow/blob/openroad/flow/docs/Known%20Issues%20and%20Limitations.pdf) for information on
conditioning your design/files for the flow. We are working to reduce the issues
and limitations, but it will take time.


## Platforms
OpenROAD-flow supports Verilog to GDS for the following open platforms:
* Nangate45 / FreePDK45

These platforms have a permissive license which allows us to redistribute the
PDK and OpenROAD platform-specific files. The platform files and license(s) are
located in `platforms/{platform}`.

OpenROAD-flow also supports the following commercial platforms:
* TSMC65LP
* GF14 (in progress)

The PDKs and platform-specific files for these kits cannot be provided due to
NDA restrictions. However, if you are able to access these platforms, you can
create the necessary platform-specific files yourself.

Once the platform is setup. Create a new design configuration with information
about the design. See sample configurations in the `design` directory.


### Adding a New Platform
At this time, we recommend looking at the [Nangate45](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow/tree/openroad/flow/platforms/nangate45) as an
example of how to set up a new platform for OpenROAD-flow.

## Implement the Design
Run `make` to perform Verilog to GDS. The final output will be located at
`flow/results/{platform}/{design_name}/6_final.gds`

## Miscellaneous
### tiny-tests - easy to add, single concern, single Verilog file

The tiny-tests are have been designed with two design goals in mind:

1. It should be trivial to add a new test: simply add a tiny standalone
   Verilog file to `OpenROAD-flow/flow/designs/src/tiny-tests`
2. Each test should be as small and as standalone as possible and be a single
   concern test.

To run a test:

```
make DESIGN_NAME=SmallPinCount DESIGN_CONFIG=`pwd`/designs/tiny-tests.mk
```

### nangate45 smoke-test harness for top level Verilog designs

1. Drop your Verilog files into designs/src/harness
2. Start the workflow:

```
make DESIGN_NAME=TopLevelName DESIGN_CONFIG=`pwd`/designs/harness.mk
```

TIP! Start with a small tiny submodule in your design with few pins
