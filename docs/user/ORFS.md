# Getting Started with OpenROAD Flow

You can get started with OpenROAD easily using our native flow, 
the OpenROAD-flow-scripts. 

OpenROAD Flow is a full RTL-to-GDS flow built entirely on open-source EDA
tools. The project aims for automated, no-human-in-the-loop digital 
circuit design with 24-hour turnaround time. For more information, refer
to this [link](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/).
