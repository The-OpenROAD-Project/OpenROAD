Where can I download OpenROAD tools?
------------------------------------

Currently, we donâ€™t provide pre-built binaries for the tools. You need
to build the tools yourself on a supported platform. Please, refer to
the :doc:`Getting Started <GettingStarted>` section to build the tools.

How can I contribute?
---------------------

Thank you for your willingness to contribute. Please, see the :doc:`Getting
Involved <../contrib/GettingInvolved>` guide.
