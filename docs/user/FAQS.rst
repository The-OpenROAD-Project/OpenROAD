Where can I download OpenROAD tools?
------------------------------------

Currently, we don’t provide pre-built binaries for the tools. You need
to build the tools yourself on a supported platform. Please, refer to
the `Getting Started <getting-started.md>`__ section to build the tools.

How can I contribute?
---------------------

Thank you for your willingness to contribute. Please, see the `Getting
Involved <../contrib/GettingInvolved.rst>`__ guide.
