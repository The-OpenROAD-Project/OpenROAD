# FAQs

## Where can I download OpenROAD tools?

Currently, we don't provide pre-built binaries for the tools. 
You need to build the tools yourself on a supported platform.
Please, refer to the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) section to build the tools.

## How can I contribute?

Thank you for your willingness to contribute. Please, see the [Getting Involved](../contrib/getting-involved.html) guide.
