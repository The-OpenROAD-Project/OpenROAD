User Guide
==========

OpenROAD is divided into a number of tools that are orchestrated
together to achieve RTL-to-GDS. As of the current implementation, the
flow is divided into three stages:

1. Logic Synthesis: is performed by `yosys`_.
2. Floorplanning through Detailed Routing: are performed by `OpenROAD App`_.
3. KLayout: GDS merge, DRC and LVS (public PDKs)

To Run OpenROAD flow, we provide scripts to automate the RTL-to-GDS
stages. Alternatively, you can run the individual steps manually.

**GitHub:** `OpenROAD-flow-scripts`_

Code Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository serves as an example RTL-to-GDS flow using the OpenROAD tools.

The two main components are:

1. **tools**: This directory contains the source code for the entire
   ``openroad`` app (via submodules) as well as other tools required for
   the flow. The script ``build_openroad.sh`` in this repository will
   automatically build the OpenROAD toolchain.

2. **flow**: This directory contains reference recipes and scripts to
   run \| designs through the flow. It also contains platforms and test
   designs.

Setup
~~~~~

The flow has the following dependencies:

-  OpenROAD
-  KLayout
-  Yosys

The dependencies can either be obtained from a pre-compiled build export
or built manually. See the `KLayout website <https://www.klayout.de/>`__
for installation instructions.

Using the flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the flow `README`_ for details about the flow and how to run designs through the flow.

Logic Synthesis

Initialize Floorplan
--------------------

::

   initialize_floorplan
   [-site site_name]          LEF site name for ROWS
   [-tracks tracks_file]      routing track specification
   -die_area "lx ly ux uy"    die area in microns
   [-core_area "lx ly ux uy"] core area in microns
   or
   -utilization util          utilization (0-100 percent)
   [-aspect_ratio ratio]      height / width, default 1.0
   [-core_space space]        space around core, default 0.0 (microns)

The die area and core size used to write ROWs can be specified
explicitly with the -die_area and -core_area arguments. Alternatively,
the die and core area can be computed from the design size and
utilization as show below:

If no -tracks file is used the routing layers from the LEF are used.

::

   core_area = design_area / (utilization / 100)
   core_width = sqrt(core_area / aspect_ratio)
   core_height = core_width * aspect_ratio
   core = ( core_space, core_space ) ( core_space + core_width, core_space + core_height )
   die = ( 0, 0 ) ( core_width + core_space * 2, core_height + core_space * 2 )

Place pins around core boundary.

::

   auto_place_pins pin_layer

Gate Resizer
------------

Gate resizer commands are described below. The resizer commands stop
when the design area is ``-max_utilization util`` percent of the core
area. ``util`` is between 0 and 100.

::

   set_wire_rc [-layer layer_name]
               [-resistance res ]
           [-capacitance cap]
           [-corner corner_name]

The ``set_wire_rc`` command sets the resistance and capacitance used to
estimate delay of routing wires. Use ``-layer`` or ``-resistance`` and
``-capacitance``. If ``-layer`` is used, the LEF technology resistance
and area/edge capacitance values for the layer are used. The units for
``-resistance`` and ``-capacitance`` are from the first liberty file
read, resistance_unit/distance_unit and liberty
capacitance_unit/distance_unit. RC parasitics are added based on placed
component pin locations. If there are no component locations no
parasitics are added. The resistance and capacitance are per distance
unit of a routing wire. Use the ``set_units`` command to check units or
``set_cmd_units`` to change units. They should represent “average”
routing layer resistance and capacitance. If the set_wire_rc command is
not called before resizing, the default_wireload model specified in the
first liberty file or with the SDC set_wire_load command is used to make
parasitics.

::

   buffer_ports [-inputs]
           [-outputs]
           -buffer_cell buffer_cell

The ``buffer_ports -inputs`` command adds a buffer between the input and
its loads. The ``buffer_ports -outputs`` adds a buffer between the port
driver and the output port. If The default behavior is ``-inputs`` and
``-outputs`` if neither is specified.

::

   resize [-libraries resize_libraries]
       [-dont_use cells]
       [-max_utilization util]

The ``resize`` command resizes gates to normalize slews.

The ``-libraries`` option specifies which libraries to use when
resizing. ``resize_libraries`` defaults to all of the liberty libraries
that have been read. Some designs have multiple libraries with different
transistor thresholds (Vt) and are used to trade off power and speed.
Chosing a low Vt library uses more power but results in a faster design
after the resizing step. Use the ``-dont_use`` option to specify a list
of patterns of cells to not use. For example, ``*/DLY*`` says do not use
cells with names that begin with ``DLY`` in all libraries.

::

   repair_max_cap -buffer_cell buffer_cell
               [-max_utilization util]
   repair_max_slew -buffer_cell buffer_cell
                   [-max_utilization util]

The ``repair_max_cap`` and ``repair_max_slew`` commands repair nets with
maximum capacitance or slew violations by inserting buffers in the net.

::

   repair_max_fanout -max_fanout fanout
                   -buffer_cell buffer_cell
                   [-max_utilization util]

The ``repair_max_fanout`` command repairs nets with a fanout greater
than ``fanout`` by inserting buffers between the driver and the loads.
Buffers are located at the center of each group of loads.

::

   repair_tie_fanout [-max_fanout fanout]
                   [-verbose]
                   lib_port

The ``repair_tie_fanout`` command repairs tie high/low nets with fanout
greater than ``fanout`` by cloning the tie high/low driver. ``lib_port``
is the tie high/low port, which can be a library/cell/port name or
object returned by ``get_lib_pins``. Clones are located at the center of
each group of loads.

::

   repair_hold_violations -buffer_cell buffer_cell
                       [-max_utilization util]

The ``repair_hold_violations`` command inserts buffers to repair hold
check violations.

::

   report_design_area

The ``report_design_area`` command reports the area of the design’s
components and the utilization.

::

   report_floating_nets [-verbose]

The ``report_floating_nets`` command reports nets with only one pin
connection. Use the ``-verbose`` flag to see the net names.

A typical resizer command file is shown below.

::

   read_lef nlc18.lef
   read_liberty nlc18.lib
   read_def mea.def
   read_sdc mea.sdc
   set_wire_rc -layer metal2
   set buffer_cell [get_lib_cell nlc18_worst/snl_bufx4]
   set max_util 90
   buffer_ports -buffer_cell $buffer_cell
   resize -resize
   repair_max_cap -buffer_cell $buffer_cell -max_utilization $max_util
   repair_max_slew -buffer_cell $buffer_cell -max_utilization $max_util
   # repair tie hi/low before max fanout so they don't get buffered
   repair_tie_fanout -max_fanout 100 Nangate/LOGIC1_X1/Z
   repair_max_fanout -max_fanout 100 -buffer_cell $buffer_cell -max_utilization $max_util
   repair_hold_violations -buffer_cell $buffer_cell -max_utilization $max_util

Note that OpenSTA commands can be used to report timing metrics before
or after resizing the design.

::

   set_wire_rc -layer metal2
   report_checks
   report_tns
   report_wns
   report_checks

   resize

   report_checks
   report_tns
   report_wns

Timing Analysis
---------------

Timing analysis commands are documented in src/OpenSTA/doc/OpenSTA.pdf.

After the database has been read from LEF/DEF, Verilog or an OpenDB
database, use the ``read_liberty`` command to read Liberty library files
used by the design.

The example script below timing analyzes a database.

::

   read_liberty liberty1.lib
   read_db reg1.db
   create_clock -name clk -period 10 {clk1 clk2 clk3}
   set_input_delay -clock clk 0 {in1 in2}
   set_output_delay -clock clk 0 out
   report_checks

                       [-clk_nets <list_of_clk_nets>]

-  ``root_buffer`` is the master cell of the buffer that serves as root
-  ``buf_list`` is the list of master cells of the buffers that can be used
   for building the clock tree.
-  ``clk_nets`` is a string containing the names of the clock roots. If
   this parameter is ommitted, TritonCTS looks for the clock roots
   automatically.
